# Student Notes

I had a bit of trouble trying to figure out how to make a function that would allow me to manipulate certain params that I needed to google and ask chatGPT for help. I also had attempted to do the bonus activity but I didn't know how to make it stretch to the entire screen.

That being said, I am still struggling with JS but definitely hanging in there.
